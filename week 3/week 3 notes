gestural interaction vs physical interaction

series: 
positive to negative, positive to negative ~ "daisy chaining effect"
-carries voltage through
-LED's will get progressively dimmer due to this lack of power
disadvantage: 1 component blows out, it effects the rest of them

parallel: 
components all share a voltage
--diminishing amperage 
advantage: if a component burns out, it does not effect others

resistor: 
-(wooden peg thing) 
-is used to balance our circuit 
-if there is a spike in power, a resistor blows out rather than a component 
--easier and cheaper to fix 

-----CODING-----

Arduino is based on C 
-"very primitive/low level language"
-precursor to processing, javascript, etc 

in js, you can just say
"var 1 = 1" and be done with it 

in Arduino, you must specify what kind of variable 
-because: very limited memory built into it 
--memory is in bytes i.e. teeny tiny 
*manage by choosing the correct variables 

Declare variables above set-up (like in p5js)
-The variable you will use the most is integer, i.e., \\int
--int cannot exceed number of bytes

--if you need bigger int use a \\long
---each long takes up 32 bytes

--\\float uses decimals
---same variable type as double in Arduino Uno (suited for more advanced boards)

--\\unsigned in front of a variable
---means that it takes out the negative value a variable can hold
---because variables can go to -32
---so instead your variable starts at 0
---sometimes you will not need a negative range, which is why this is used 
---apparently it is common in examples we will view

\\char means characters
-denoted by single letters aka characters

\\string vs String
-does not exist in C, so was built into Arduino
-lowercase \\string is an array of characters
(---more complicated; we'll come back to this later)

-uppercase \\String is an object that includes an array of characters
--therefore gives you more functions to play around with

-There is a reference of different variables in Zeven's week 3 notes: https://github.com/zevenrodriguez/CIM542-642/tree/master/week3

---The Serial Library---
-built into Arduino 
-allows Arduino to communicate w computer 
-can send & receive commands

2 general types of Serial messages:
Serial.print
Serial.println

basically like console.log 

baudrate = speed at which messages are relayed
standard is 9600
bluetooth is at the speed of 115200

Serial.begin(9600);
-begins signal to relay messages

Serial.printlh adds linebreak 

\\  Serial.println("num: " + num); generates crazy random chains of letters/numbers

HOMEWORK: Use switch system to turn on and off 2 LED's. Think of a use for it.
