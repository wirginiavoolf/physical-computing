~making things~

physical installation is a "hot marketing gimmick"
-takes times
-custom pieces come from scratch
-must understand how things are utilized

there is a disconnect between people who "make" things & people who "design" them



~3D modeling~

best color to use for 3d printing - acryllic 
-fragile, but
-can use solvent to put together


**we will use**
free online software: onshape 
onshape.com


YOU NEED:
-a tape measurer
-a caliber 

**3d printers work in milimeters**

When measuring for 3d - give wiggle room, aka "tolerance"

3d printers print from a "top view," so consider orientation while designing
3d printers design on 3 planes, so orient your planes 
--you can click on the plane you want to sketch upon (e.g., top)
--start with a flat sketch & build into 3d piece

*scale is important (parametric modeler)

idea: maybe i can design some sort of sphere that rolls & triggers sonar sensor? 
other idea: you can design 3d text in the software

**make sure hardware excelleration is enabled in chrome (settings -> advanced settings -> enable hardware excelleration)

if you're creating something interactive - 
measure the hand (or other relevant user part)

limit on size: 200 x 200 x 200 mm
