HOMEWORK: 
Set up Github repository called "Physical Computing"
Create a readme.md 
Create a "fantasy machine" -- what would you make if you had all the possibilities in the world?
**Check Zeven's Github page for details 

physical computing day 1 notes

means building interactive physical systems by the use of software and hardware (can sense & respond to analog world)

reverse engineering: 
+ assistive technology: inventions that ease tasks for people with disabilities (i.e. shoe tieing)
++ can save lies (water canary)
++ arts & gaming/fun (rubix cube solver)

micro controllers: teeny tiny CPU 
|____> vs system on chip, i.e. a raspberry pi, or lappy

"internet of things" - devices that connect to the internet 
+ get you a wifi adapter "arduino yun"
+ raspberry pi 
+ conductive ink?!?!?!?!?! makes circuit connections w/ pen

uses open source software
+ open source hardware aka CERN-OHL
++ uses a general public license (GPL)
++ be "open" about how it works 


Basic Concepts of Electricity 

Electricity: Always follows the path of least resistance 
positive + voltage / negative - voltage
|_> what we will mostly deal with 

Anode (+): an electrode through which positive electric charge flows
Cathode (-): from which a conventional current leaves a polarized electronical flow 

AC (alternating current) vs DC (direct current)
AC -periodically reverses direction
DC -flow is only in one direction 

Analog vs Digital 
Analog: 
-infinite possibilities
-signals may be limited to a range of max & min values
-waves are smooth & continuous 

Digital:
-discrete possibilities 
-most common signals are of 2 values
-waves are stepping, square, and discrete 

}}}}}Watts = Volts * Amps{{{{{

Analogy: 
Volts - Water Pressure (strength)
Amps - Flow (speed)
Resistance - Size of Pipe (intensity, sorta -- or focus)

resistance - not all components are rated the same 
-3 basic voltages: 12, 5, 3.3 
-LED's run on 1.5 volts 
so - you need resistors to reduce current flow & lower voltage within circuits
-- like kinking a water hose 
RESISTORS ARE MEASURED IN Ohm's (which is the coolest shit I've heard today)

Diodes: allow current to pass in one director while blocking current in the opposite direction
LED is a type of diode 

Relay: electrically operated switch (on/off - like a turn signal in a car)
--early of basic computation, evolved into:

Transistor: electro-mechanical switch 

Series vs Parallel -- Christmas Lights 
Series: Whole string burns out
Parallel: Only one burns out
