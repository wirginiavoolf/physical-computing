#The Metaphorator 

##A 3D Metaphor Printer

1. Speak into the metaphor machine about any concern - rants and catharsis are best.

2A. The Metaphorator generates an image-based metaphor based on your emotional state.
2B. The Metaphorator can access a library of pre-written metaphors or generate a new one. 

3. The Metaphorator conveys the image through a line of text on the screen. The user can accept, reject, or modify the metaphor. 

4. When the user is satisfied with their image, the Metaphorator prints a 3D model based on the metaphor. 



##Example: 

User states: "I feel anxious"

Metaphorator generates a line of text - 

"I once watched a horse
make her way back to land mid-hurricane: having
ridden, surfer-like, the very waves that at any moment
could have overwhelmed her in their crash to shore, she
shook herself, looked back once on the water’s restlessness — 
history’s always restless — and the horse stepped free." (Carl Phillips, Monomoy)

User accepts the metaphor

Metaphor 3D prints a model of a horse in a wave

##Purpose

The purpose of the Metaphorator is to generate physical relics for emotional states. The intention is to create a collaborative art process that could not exist if not for both human emotions and artificial intelligence. Additionally, the Metaphorator may have a practical application as a tool for processing negative emotions related to stress.
