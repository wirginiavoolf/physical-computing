#Digital Contrapuntal
##An Interactive Poem 
#####Updated 3/26/2017

###In poetry, a contrapuntal is a form where a poem is written in columns, and can be read both horizontally or vertically. Using a max sonar sensor and an LCD screen, I have created an interactive contrapuntal. Initially, the left column of my poem, "Hypervigilance (w/ Emily Dickinson," is displayed. When a user approaches the sensor, the second column of text displays on the second line.

###Parts

####-Max Sonar Sensor
####-LCD Screen
####-Arduino Uno
####-Wooden confectioners box. 
####-Wires of various length

####The parts are installed inside of the box. 

###Code

####The code of the project uses an if/else statement; when a user comes within a range of distance, the text on the LCD screen changes. 

###Challenges To Address

####The main challenge of this project has to do with the physical installation; the LCD screen requires many wires to work, and it is difficult to fix them inside of the box. Going forward, I am going to be looking to alternate board set-ups that might require less use of wire, so that this interactive object is displayable.
