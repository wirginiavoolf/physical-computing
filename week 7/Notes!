Notes!


Arrays: 

char charArray[] = "hello"; //scare quotes automatically breaks words into characters?
char charArray2[] = {'a', 'b'};

-Can use to split sentences? 

*Arduino does not have "concept of .length"
Best way around this: declare variable as array length

const int buttonArray[bArrayLength] = {2,3};
const int ledArray[lArrayLength] = {12,13};

Link to example on Array Types: https://github.com/zevenrodriguez/CIM542-642/blob/master/arduino/arrayTypes/arrayTypes.ino

-You can create an array of pinmodes and then use a for loop to break it up 
~~as opposed to writing "pinMode" every time 

To Manipulate HTML: Need Arduino Ethernet stuff 
For Midterm: Have a PrintLN word appear trigged based on distance 
-Could also use LED screen 

So, possible alternate midterm: A few LED lights that selectively fade or get brighter based on sonar input 
Other possible materials: 
-Arduino Zero, bc it's 32bit 
-MKRZero, comes with SD 
-MKR1000, has built in WiFi 

MULTIMETER ~ 
-can be used to check voltage on a device
-touch cables to power & ground gables on Arduino to read voltage
-touch cables to resistor to get a guess at what kind it is 

-good debugging tool b/c you can test continunity with electrical currents 
-check all wires for continuity 

WIRESTRIPPER ~ 
26 gauge wire is the one you'll find on campus
-used to cut stranded wire
--solid core wire is best for arduino 

Saudering: Use range 500-700~800
Saudering irons can very easily start fires so watch ur back & never leave it unattended 
Use a thing to catch excess sauder 
- best is a brillo pad bc you don't have to wet it 
- you can use a wet sponge or paper towel
